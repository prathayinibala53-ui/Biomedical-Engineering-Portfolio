# Biomedical Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases some of my projects in biomedical signal processing, wearable technology, and EEG/ECG analysis. Each project is linked below with a brief description. Note that the motion tracking project is still ongoing. This portfolio highlights a selection of my work and does not represent the full extent of my projects, in order to avoid conflicts with school submissions.
